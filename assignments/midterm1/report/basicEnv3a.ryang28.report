Welcome to the Picoml Evaluation Environment Tester 

In the following, you will be given a series of declaration together with 
the output OCaml would print.  After each declaration, you are asked to type 
in the environment in effect after all the declarations up to that point have 
been executed.

Please enter environments using the following syntax. The environment is a
possibly empty sequence of comma separated bindings surrounded by curly braces,
{  }. A binding is given by an identifier followed by -> followed by its value.
The particular value of a closure is written with a starting < followed by the
formal parameter of the closure followed by -> followed by the body of the
closure, followed by a comma, followed by a closing >. As an example, the
environment that maps a to 2 and b to 17 is written { a -> 2, b -> 17} and the
closure for fun x -> x + a + b is written < x -> x + a + b, { a -> 2, b -> 17} >.

2 + 5;;
Your answer was: {}
That is correct!

let x = 6;;
Your answer was: {x -> 6}
That is correct!

let y = x * 2;;
Your answer was: {x -> 6, y -> 12}
That is correct!

let w = x + y 
  in 2 + w;;
Your answer was: {x -> 6, y -> 12}
That is correct!

let g y = y + x;;
Your answer was: {g -> <y -> y  +  x, {x -> 6, y -> 12}>, x -> 6, y -> 12}
That is correct!

let x = g x;;
Your answer was: {g -> <y -> y  +  x, {x -> 6, y -> 12}>, x -> 12, y -> 12}
That is correct!

let p x y = (x,y);;
Your answer was: {g -> <y -> y  +  x, {x -> 6, y -> 12}>, p -> <x -> fun y -> (x , y), {g -> <y -> y  +  x, {x -> 6, y -> 12}>, x -> 12, y -> 12}>, x -> 12, y -> 12}
That is correct!
You have completed the assignment.  Your score is 21
